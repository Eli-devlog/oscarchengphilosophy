      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of analytic philosophy, design studies, and
        digital systems. My current project reframes design as an epistemic architecture—how interfaces shape what feels
        credible, knowable, or actionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Training: Language & Communication (HKU), Criminology (HKU/Oxford). Methods: conceptual engineering, philosophy
        of language, postphenomenology; with hands-on interest in UI patterns and design research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond research, I write short essays, build small UI prototypes, and help students clarify research questions.
